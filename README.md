# unfolded-sql-helper
A small class + demo to help create SQL queries for rill_safegraph_database for people who don't know much SQL. If you already know SQL, some of the functions in here might still be useful.

This helps you query safegraph data (and more) directly in python and load it directly into a pandas dataframe for immediate use. Although be aware that large queries may timeout.
